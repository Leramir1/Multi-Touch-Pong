Multi-Touch-Pong
================
Hello, this is an assignment where my group and I explored the differences between multi-touch and mouse point interaction by recreating a classic game called Pong. The framework we based the project off is called Multi-Touch for Java(MT4J) with a built in TUIO server for less supplementary work. We also used Community Core Vision(CCV) software version 1.5 to perform advanced visual tracking. In order to capture the video image we used a Andriod app called DroidCam version 4.1, which enabled us to send feed from the phone's back camera to the DriodCam client on the desktop. The DriodCam client transfers the data to CCV, CCV then turns the video feed into "Blobs" and MT4J then turns the blobs into multitouch intructions.
